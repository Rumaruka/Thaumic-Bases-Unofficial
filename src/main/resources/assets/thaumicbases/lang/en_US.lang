#Researchs
research_name.thaumicbases:thaumicbases=Thaumic Bases: First Step
research_stage.thaumicbases:thaumicbases.1=Okay, I hardly understand what this new page gives. Can I learning something, maybe find answer my question? Hmm, unlike the main book here everything is open. It`s interesting!
research_stage.thaumicbases:thaumicbases.2=I did it! What? Well, I opened a new research!

research_name.thaumicbases:tbalchemy=Thaumic Bases: Alchemy
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbalchemy.1=If I make Thaumium Ingot, then hmmm.....
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbalchemy.2=Nice i make new things, I write recipes. Wow, I make new metall - Thauminite

research_name.thaumicbases:tbfluid=Thaumic Bases: Fluids
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbfluid.1=I have one idea. What happens if a bucket of lava is thrown into a cauldron? Hmm, it's time to make some calculations!
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbfluid.2=Wow, It`s strange fluid. After placed, she damage and transform in solid block...,after breaking block i did blaze rod. Yay.
Oh, if i spill purifying fluid, Pyrofluid (yes, i call this - "Pyrofluid") freezes fluid faster!
research_name.thaumicbases:tbplant=Thaumic Bases: Basic Plants
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbplant.1=Oops, I dropped the seeds in the cauldron ... and what if I add some aspects?
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbplant.2=Thaumaturhy is rich in directions it affects. Alchemy, Infusion, Enchanting... Thaumaturgy can do everything... However, most thaumaturges ignore a very important aspect - the plants and plantlife. You, however, are not "most thaumaturges". This direction of researches promises alot, you can already see the possibilities of this. Well, it is so research rich that even this fact has allowed you to figure out the creation of the first Thaumic Plant - the Sweed. This is technically a weed. However, should you let it grow for a little - it will grow to a full size, and can be harvested to drop sugar and reeds. However, it should be watched over, since it does rapidly spreads!

research_name.thaumicbases:tbplant1=Thaumic Bases: Awesome Plants
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbplant1.1=So, it's time to improve the plants, I have a long night for experiments!
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbplant1.2=So, I spent this night and brought out a lot of plants! "§oAurelia§r" - Upon your thaumaturgic researches there has always been one aspect, that is extremely annoying to get - Auram. That one has extreme potential in crafting usage  venture to the depths of the nether to kill wisps, which is no good as well. You, however, using your plant knowledge have discovered a way of getting that aspect without doing any of other ways. This plant when exposed to the moonlight will open up it's petals to let the moonlight come in - it seems like the plant feeds of moonlight. However, due to the air of the very world it is only possible during full moon. The plant will ocassionally loose it's petals, and they can be gathered from the ground near the flower. Those petals are extremly rich on Auram essentia. However, the plant will only feed from the moon if it has a direct view over it! "§oBriar§r" - Plants are known for their medicinal uses. However, thaumaturges often do not care about this side of nature. You do care. You have managed to bring the Rose bush back to it's wild state, thus creating a Briar plant. Briar is a 1 block tall plant that will grow pretty fast. Once grown it's seed bags can be collected for a later usage. They can be combined with sugar in your Arcane Workbench to create a Rosehip Syrup. This item acts just like a better milk - it stacks up to 16, and it is known for helping thaumaturges with some warp effects. It will not work with some purely mental effects though... "§oGlieonia Seed§r" - What's the most awesome thing about thaumaturgy? Flight! Well, what is the next best thing? Warding foci? Well, what is the thrid best thing... Digging foci, really? We are talking about Nitor, okay?! Jees. Anyway, Nitor is pretty amazing - it shines brightly, creates fancy particles, all that fancy stuff! Well, there is one thing - it requires glowstone to make... A wise thaumaturge can solve this nuance! You have managed to create a plant, that once fully grown will drop 2 Glowstone dust. interestingly enough the flower does not emmit any light whatsoever, even when fully grown... Why could that be?.. "§oFluxium§r" - This plant looks funny. You had no intentions on constructing something like that, but - oh well, you are here, with this thing in your hands, it is a little too late to worry about things. You have created a flower that activly absorbs flux from nearby air - however, it instantly builds up again - and once it has collected enough flux it releases it in a form of Flux Gas above itself. You are not sure about the uses of this plant, but it's ability to absorb aspects from surroundings seems interesting, maybe it can be used as a base for something bigger?.. "§oLazullia Seeds§r" - Sometimes a thaumaturge needs some lapis for his... thaumaturgy. And sometimes a thaumaturge is just too lazy to venture down into caves just to spend a good 5 hours searching for that blue ore. You have once again used plants to aid you with this noncense. Lazullia will slowly grow and once fully grown can be harvested. Upon harvesting a thaumaturge will recieve some Lapis Lazuli alongside with a seed. "§oMetalleat Seeds§r" - Sometimes a thaumaturge needs some metallum for his ore processing. And there goes an iron ingot. Sometimes a thaumaturge needs metallum for his crafts. And there goes more iron. You have discovered a way to put an end to this misery - by infusing a regular wheat seeds in a crucible with some metallum and victus to keep the life in the seeds you have managed to create a plant, that grows exactly like wheat, but gets tough and metallic in the latest stages of growth. It then can be harvested to obtain some Iron Nuggets. This discovery asks more questions than it answeres though, and you might need to research it further... As far as you can tell you can't replicate the same with thaumium. "§oLucrite Seeds§r" - You have researched the Metalleat further and discovered, that you can create a similar crop by infusing a carrot with Lucrum. The result is a very strange crop. It functions just like the Metalleat, but takes twice as much time to grow. It is also very magic dependant - without strong enough source of magic beneath the soil it grows in it refuses to grow. Those Salis Mundus blocks seem to be just as perfect as possible. It will also accept bonemeal with much slower rate, taking 7 bonemeal to grow. However, should you let it grow and it will grow some Golden Nuggets on it's branches. Since it is a carrot it is also possible to obtain one from the crop! "§oPlax Seeds§r" - Sometimes a thaumaturge just needs to get him some string - for magical candles or for magical clothes - it does not matter that much what for. And sometimes a thaumaturge just does not want to fight spiders for endless nights or shear sheep for wool to process later. You have applied the knowledge of plants and nature you've just learned to solve the problem for you. The result is a strange crop, named Plax, which will grow on farmland in 8 stages and once fully grown will produce 3 string! It functions just like a regular wheat crop - it also needs light and will only grow on farmland. "§oRedlon Seed§r" - Even though thaumaturgy is a magical art and is not related to industry in any way a lot of magical devices can actually operate or be controlled by that mythical red dust - the Redstone. Actually redstone seems pretty magical itself. What if you combine it with a plant? Well, the result is a plant, that will slowly grow a Block Of Redstone, just like a Melon or a Pumpkin. It however requires much more time than melons or pumpkins. "§oTobacco Seeds§r" - Sometimes a thaumaturge just wants some resting from all those horrors of the thaumaturgy. He wants his mind clear and concentrated on the tasks. Other thaumaturges are known to smoke some kind of tobacco, but it harms the health of the thaumaturge a great deal, and can even cut of the link between a human and the world of magic. You do not need this. You have managed to create a plant, that functions just like a tobacco, but it is absolutely fine for your health! Unfortunately you are sure, that your plant is the only one safe, and noone, apart from you can replicate it. Oh well. To properly rest a thaumaturge like you needs 3 things - a nice house, and you should have one already, his smoking pipe and some tobacco. To properly make the tobacco a thaumaturge must grind the leaves of a plant. You might need a Pestle and Mortar to do so. You will also need your smoking pipe, but you do not want those mundane pipes, do you? You have discovered a way to properly infuse some Greatwood planks to make a perfect pipe. It is also good for your magic contact, since it has a Salis Mundus as one of it's components. By smoking the most mundane tobacco thaumaturges do not gain much. But your tobacco is not so mundane, as is your pipe. You have a small chance to get rid of some Temporary warp by casually smoking it. You are sure, that you can do stuff with the tobacco to make it more efficent, you just need to figure out - what. The tobaco is consumed in the process. The pipe chooses a first tobaco in a thaumaturge's pockets, the same way the bow chooses an arrow to shoot. A thaumaturge like you will also take some time to smoke - why the rush? "§oVoid Plant Seed§r" - Those Void Seeds are created by infusing a regular seed with a bunch of Alienis and Tenebrae. However, the seed itself looses the ability to grow - you are overinfusing it. However, it might be possible to bring the seed back to life using the knowledge of plants you've just learned! By infusing a void seed with all kinds of plantlife you have managed to return the ability to grow to the poor seed.
research_name.thaumicbases:tbcactus=Thaumic Bases: Rainbow Cactus
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbcactus.1=I think, if i have very more plants, maybe make experiments with cactus?
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbcactus.2=Magic is not always strict and logical - it is magic, afterall. The same goes to life - it can take various shapes, sometimes shocking, sometimes funny. Well, you have managed to create a plant, that, pretty much, is a definition of the word 'funny'. This plant functions just like the regular cacti - must be placed on sand and grows up to 3 blocks. However, once broken it will only drop itself it it is the last cacti block left. Otherwise it will drop all kinds of dyes. however, cacti can't create certain dye types, like bonemeal and Lapis. It is also more likely to drop green dye than other dyes.

research_name.thaumicbases:tbtree=Thaumic Bases: Power Gold
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbtree.1=Not only weeds and flowers can be magically processed to create something new! Trees have that potential too! However, they are too strong on their own, and therefore they resist any simple magical additions. Infusion should do the job just fine! You have managed to create a Golden Oak tree, just as an example. This tree works just as regular Oak does, however, should it drop an apple - and that apple will be covered in gold! It, however, is impossible to get the mythical Enchanted Golden Apple. Due to being infused with Greed essentia tree will drop much less saplings, since it wants to be the only one absorbing the sunlight and water

research_name.thaumicbases:tbtree1=Thaumic Bases: Power Ender
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbtree1.1=It`s like on Golden Tree, but leaves have ender pearl.

research_name.thaumicbases:tbtree2=Thaumic Bases: Power Nether
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbtree2.1=It`s like on Golden Tree, but leaves have magma cream.

research_name.thaumicbases:tbdeco=Thaumic Bases: Decoration Blocks
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbdeco.1=You like old blocks... I`m like old blocks. Okay, I have way make my favorite decoration

research_name.thaumicbases:tbdeco2=Thaumic Bases: Decoration Blocks pt2
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbdeco2.1=Ooops, I`m forget. I make addition for "Thaumic Bases: Decoration Blocks",but this block very coolest and have power for Infusion!

research_name.thaumicbases:tbmacerator=Thaumic Bases: Macerator
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbmacerator.1=IC2, Thermal Expansions, Mekanism, EnderIO? Phhhh, I have new solution!
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbmacerator.2=Okay, I`m like techinical, but  thaumaturge have new way for macerator!

research_name.thaumicbases:tbadvmacerator=Thaumic Bases: Advanced Macerator
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbadvmacerator.1=I try improve this research!
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbadvmacerator.2=Okay, I found solution. Just add Aspect "Fabrico"!

research_name.thaumicbases:tbexchang=Thaumic Bases: Exchange
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbexchang.1=I like transform thing into another. I need to check something, but can I do it?
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbexchang.2=Yay, I`m master...

research_name.thaumicbases:tbdouble=Thaumic Bases: Doubling
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbdouble.1=I hate losing resources, it's time to increase them ....
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbdouble.2=I found a way, of course, without any problems, I suffered a lot when mixing aspects, but the result was achieved. I write recipes.

research_name.thaumicbases:tbmachanism=Thaumic Bases: Mechanics
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbmachanism.1=Try make awesome Mechanism!
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbmachanism.2=Thaumaturges often use their magic to infuse regular mundane items with magical force, making them better. This process is called enchanting. Thaumaturges have also discovered a way to do the same with an Infusion Altar, using it to make items stronger. However, there always seems to be a limit to the magic infused into the item... You have managed to push that limit a little bit further. You have managed to create an Overchanting table, which is able to increase the level of enchantments on the item by one. Not only could it get items closer to the desired level, it can do more - it can increase the level beyound maximum, allowing enchantments like Fortune more V, or Sharpness X.
The device will improve the first enchantment on the item. The order is the same as for the displayment of the enchantments in the item's description. Previously buffed enchantments will be skipped - the device is not quite powerfull enough to do thinks like Sharpness XI. It does not take the enchantment into account, so thinks like Silk Touch more are possible, yet useless. To infuse the item just put it in the only slot available and start the overchanting process by using your caster on the table. Then the Praecantatio essentia will be drawn from nearby jars into the table - you will need 32 Praecantatio in total. The table also requires a player nearby, since in the middle of the process it will use 30 levels from the player in range of 6 blocks!
Overchanting can be stopped in any time just by taking the item from the table, but the levels and the essentia will be wasted then. The table will draw Praecantatio from the range of 8 blocks, mirrors will also do the job just fine. Upon sapping experience the table will skip players with level before 30, so having multiple people with an overhaul level of 30 will not work. Any item with enchantments can be overchanted. Putting a not enchanted item in the Overchanting table does nothing.

research_name.thaumicbases:tbspikes=Thaumic Bases: Simple Spikes
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbspikes.1=So, I try make new system of traps
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbspikes.2=Sometimes a thaumaturge just wants to stydy his researches. Calm, alone and without any zombies at his back. Sure, sometimes a door might just be enough. Sometimes, however, a thaumaturge may want those fools to suffer. It's a shame thaumaturgy does not offer a way of passivly killing enemies... Or does it? You have managed to create a block, that will damage everyone who steps on it. However it also tears apart items dropped by fools. There might be a way to resolve this problem... A thaumaturge may also notice, that after killing a creature the spikes get covered in blood. To wipe the blood out you need to use your Enchanted Fabric on the spikes. The fabric will get covered in blood, but it can be cleared in a crucible.

research_name.thaumicbases:tbspikes1=Thaumic Bases: Advanced Spikes
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbspikes1.1=You have managed to improve your spikes using that thaumic metal - Thaumium. Those new spikes are sharper - they will kill fools who step on them faster than the mundane iron spikes. They are also much more picky when it comes to damaging foes - they will not destroy items. They are also sensitive to Redstone signal, and therefore will not damage anyone if they are powered by it!

research_name.thaumicbases:tbspikes2=Thaumic Bases: Awesome Spikes
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbspikes2.1=You have managed to apply your knowledge of that strange metal made out of darkness to your spikes. The resulting spikes are extremely dangerous - they can almost instantly kill whoever walks over them. They will also not destroy items, just like Thaumic. They also react to the redstone the same way thaumic spikes do. They, however, are somehow much more accurate at their job, which results in foes dropping experience and aspects, just as they got killed by you. The spikes however can't hurt void metal, since they are made of it...

research_name.thaumicbases:tbbloodfabric=Thaumic Bases: Bloody Fabric
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbbloodfabric.1=Sometimes a thaumaturge just wants to stydy his researches. Calm, alone and without any zombies at his back. Sure, sometimes a door might just be enough. Sometimes, however, a thaumaturge may want those fools to suffer. It's a shame thaumaturgy does not offer a way of passivly killing enemies... Or does it? You have managed to create a block, that will damage everyone who steps on it. However it also tears apart items dropped by fools. There might be a way to resolve this problem... A thaumaturge may also notice, that after killing a creature the spikes get covered in blood. To wipe the blood out you need to use your Enchanted Fabric on the spikes. The fabric will get covered in blood, but it can be cleared in a crucible.

research_name.thaumicbases:tbusefire=Thaumic Bases: Fire Magic
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbusefire.1=§oCampfire§r - If a person wanders around for example in the forest when it is getting dark and he is too far away from home to go to his bed he is probably stuck there in the darkness with all those monsters around. You are a thaumaturge, sure you can solve that problem! You have discovered a way to make a campfire! To light it up you first need to right-click it with a log - magical logs may be more long-lasting. Next just insert any fuel in it. Now this little beacons!
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbusefire.2=§oBrazier§r - Well, the campfire is well and good, but there is a problem - it requires way too much manual control over itself. You need to toss in logs, you need to toss in fuel. Maybe thaumaturgy can help you with this? And it sure can! You have improved the construction of the campfire. The brazier will do exactly the same, but it does not require manual fuel/logs insertion - it will instead drain ignis essentia from nearby jars and mirrors.

research_name.thaumicbases:tbtobacco=Thaumic Bases: Tobacco
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbtobacco.1=§oMortar§r - Main tools for fragmentation tobacco leaves.§oSmoking Pipes§r - Pipes 2 types "Greatwood and Silverwood", "Greatwood" give more debuffs after smoking and warping.  §oTobacco Pile§r - Sometimes a thaumaturge just wants some resting from all those horrors of the thaumaturgy. He wants his mind clear and concentrated on the tasks. Other thaumaturges are known to smoke some kind of tobacco, but it harms the health of the thaumaturge a great deal, and can even cut of the link between a human and the world of magic. You do not need this. You have managed to create a plant, that functions just like a tobacco, but it is absolutely fine for your health! Unfortunately you are sure, that your plant is the only one safe, and no one, apart from you can replicate it. Oh well. To properly rest a thaumaturge like you needs 3 things - a nice house, and you should have one already, his smoking pipe and some tobacco. To properly make the tobacco a thaumaturge must grind the leaves of a plant. You might need a Pestle and Mortar to do so. You will also need your smoking pipe, but you do not want those mundane pipes, do you? You have discovered a way to properly infuse some Greatwood planks to make a perfect pipe. It is also good for your magic contact, since it has a Salis Mundus as one of it's components. By smoking the most mundane tobacco thaumaturges do not gain much. But your tobacco is not so mundane, as is your pipe. You have a small chance to get rid of some Temporary warp by casually smoking it. You are sure, that you can do stuff with the tobacco to make it more efficent, you just need to figure out - what. The tobaco is consumed in the process. The pipe chooses a first tobaco in a thaumaturge's pockets, the same way the bow chooses an arrow to shoot. A thaumaturge like you will also take some time to smoke - why the rush?
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbtobacco.2=§oAngry Tobacco Pile§r - You have long ago heard about some kind of warriors of fury, who used to smoke before each battle. They were a very scary warriors - without pain and with unstopabble fury they once were tearing their enemies apart. They are long gone, but the secret of their battle fury? You have discovered a way to infuse your tobacco with required magic to get a piece of their fury. Smoke this tobacco before a battle - and you will tear your enemies apart, just like those warriors! §oRelaxing Tobacco Pile§r - Well, most thaumaturges use different smoking herbs to 'relax'. You do not need that kind of relaxation, no. They are fools, who will soon loose their magic if they continue doing so! However, your mind might need some relaxation from that warp. Sure, just a regular tobacco does the trick, but you can do it better, can you?.. You have created a perfect tobacco, which calms down your nerves and removes temporary warp. §oWisdoom Tobacco Pile§r - You have gone beyond the relaxing properties of the tobacco. Infusing your tobacco with knowledge sure was a great idea - you have managed to create a tobacco, which puts you in a crystal clear mind state once you smoke it. The effect lasts a mere second, though it is more than enough to make a shocking discovery or two. However, you are afraid, that you may also see something horrible there, which will corrupt your mind... Well, who does not risk - does not get his reward, right? §oEldritch Tobacco Pile§r - You have discovered a way to infuse regular tobacco powder with some eldritch energy. The result may not be that safe to smoke, however, should a thaumaturge smoke such a thing his vision will go grim for some time. Thaumaturge with such a vision should not look at living beings. It is also possible to attract the attention of "eldritch" by doing so, however the chances are low. The tobacco might cause sanity problems! §oSaturating Tobacco Pile§r - You have found a way to stop hunger starvation. Smoking the tobacco with the addition of seeds and some primal aspects tricks the mind into thinking, that the body has already feasted. As you can guess it is pretty dangerous, since the body is not recieving food, but if things get too tough this may help you last for a while. It, however, can have some negatives on your body, so you might want to be carefull. §oWispy Tobacco Pile§r - What happens if you infuse more magic into your tobacco? That is an interesting questing, but the answer is much more facinating! You have discovered a way to properly infuse some magic into your tobacco. The result seems to be fairly safe to smoke - it does not seem to carry negatives within itself. However, should you smoke such a tobacco a tiny life form pops out of your smoking pipe - a Wisp. It also seems rather angry - you think that's because wisps do not like enclosed spaces. Or maybe the smoke is the reason? §oMiner`s Tobacco Pile§r - You have heard of some mythical herbs that can gain their smoker such a strength that they are able to break stone in mere seconds with bare fists! Old tales of the east. It might be impossible to break stones in a mere second, but you have managed to create a tobacco, that will at least help you with casual mining. Smoke it before you go mining, and you should be able to mine stone and ores much faster than regular. The effect sure will wear of ofter some time too. §oTainted Tobacco Pile§r - You are not quite sure why you have even discovered this. Sure, now you can infuse your tobacco with taint, forever changing it, so anyone, who smokes it will have his mind corrupted by taint, and all the horrors of the dark will appear in his mind, but what is it even usefull for? The taint pieces also leave tiny signs on the pipe of the smoker. You are interested in the ways this will affect things like silverwood... Probably nothing good though.
